# Rules

1. Do not run `bun run dev` on your own, the maintainer is going to run it by himself.
2. Use `bun verify` to verify code quality after changes (except for markdown files).
3. If some files became staged, do not return them to unstaged mode. Do not stage any files.
4. If you've decided that a feature/refactor/task would require more than 1 slice, describe every slice's requirements in PRD for that feature/refactor/task
5. For work, state the outcome, acceptance criteria, allowed side effects, and verification evidence before making broad edits. Prefer repo-specific success criteria over step-by-step process prompts.
6. Keep migrations narrow: update active model strings and directly related prompts only. Leave historical docs, examples, eval baselines, low-cost fallbacks, and ambiguous model references unchanged unless the user explicitly asks to upgrade them.
7. Preserve existing reasoning, verbosity, structured-output, and tool schemas when they are already present.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs are tracked as local markdown files under `.scratch/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The default five-role triage vocabulary is used: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context layout: root `CONTEXT.md` plus root `docs/adr/` when present. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

# 12-rule

These rules apply to every task in this project unless explicitly overridden.
Bias: caution over speed on non-trivial work. Use judgment on trivial tasks.

## Rule 1 — Think Before Coding

State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask rather than guess.
Present multiple interpretations when ambiguity exists.
Push back when a simpler approach exists.
Stop when confused. Name what's unclear.

## Rule 2 — Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
No features beyond what was asked. No abstractions for single-use code.
Test: would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

## Rule 3 — Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
Don't refactor what isn't broken. Match existing style.

## Rule 4 — Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.
Don't follow steps. Define success and iterate.
Strong success criteria let you loop independently.

## Rule 5 — Use the model only for judgment calls

Use me for: classification, drafting, summarization, extraction.
Do NOT use me for: routing, retries, deterministic transforms.
If code can answer, code answers.

## Rule 6 — Token budgets are not advisory

Per-task: 4,000 tokens. Per-session: 30,000 tokens.
If approaching budget, summarize and start fresh.
Surface the breach. Do not silently overrun.

## Rule 7 — Surface conflicts, don't average them

If two patterns contradict, pick one (more recent / more tested).
Explain why. Flag the other for cleanup.
Don't blend conflicting patterns.

## Rule 8 — Read before you write

Before adding code, read exports, immediate callers, shared utilities.
"Looks orthogonal" is dangerous. If unsure why code is structured a way, ask.

## Rule 9 — Tests verify intent, not just behavior

Tests must encode WHY behavior matters, not just WHAT it does.
A test that can't fail when business logic changes is wrong.

## Rule 10 — Checkpoint after every significant step

Summarize what was done, what's verified, what's left.
Don't continue from a state you can't describe back.
If you lose track, stop and restate.

## Rule 11 — Match the codebase's conventions, even if you disagree

Conformance > taste inside the codebase.
If you genuinely think a convention is harmful, surface it. Don't fork silently.

## Rule 12 — Fail loud

"Completed" is wrong if anything was skipped silently.
"Tests pass" is wrong if any were skipped.
Default to surfacing uncertainty, not hiding it.
